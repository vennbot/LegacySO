LegacySO is a child project of FreeSO (see link to original repo below). FreeSO is a full reimplementation of The Sims Online, using Monogame. While FreeSO aimed to be faithful to the original game, it included many quality of life changes such as hardware rendering, custom dynamic lighting, hi-res output and >2 floor houses. While there used to be an official FreeSO server, FreeSO is now a technology base for other The Sims Online servers to build upon. Please see the https://freeso.org blog for more information. In the future, a client specifically suited to exploring the original FreeSO server alone or with friends will be made available in a different repository.

FreeSO currently depends on the original game files (objects, avatars, ui) to function, which are available for download from EA servers. FreeSO is simply a game engine, and does not contain any copyrighted material in and of itself.

LegacySO looks to maintain the core experience of FreeSO whilst keeping the door open to a continuation of its mission in the future. For more information please visit our website at https://legacyso.org
