Click one of the 'Create a New Sim' buttons to begin creating your first alter-ego. You can use these sims to specialize in different skills, be a roommate at various properties, or roleplay as different characters. Remember, playing as more than one Sim at a time is not allowed and may lead to account punishments or an account ban!"
