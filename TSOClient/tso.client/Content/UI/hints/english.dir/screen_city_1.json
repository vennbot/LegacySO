You'll want to land on an open property and say hello, so let's go though that.\n\nThe window you see on the bottom right is called 'Gizmo', and lets you filter out the most popular properties and search for ones you know the name of. Properties in the game have different categories - at LegacySO we recommend players visit the Simland Ilses Town Hall (a 'Community' category) property. From here, you can teleport to other open properties. Alternatively you can look around the city and find one yourself!\n\nYou can also explore the city to find open properties by location. Open properties will show as flashing red dots on the map - simply click to zoom in, then click any of the flashing lots to get started."
