Offbeat lots in LegacySO benefit from players being able to overfill their Comfort and Hunger and Fun motives! Propreties with this category usually try to bring something different to the city, and entertain the players rather than the sims. If a property in this category is popular, you know it's for a good reason. \n\nMotives: [s][color=#B3FF99]Easy[/color][/s], Speciality: [s]Nothing... Yet![/s] \n[s][color=white]Overfill: 50% Hunger & Comfort, 100% Fun[/color][/s]"
